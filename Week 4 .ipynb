    "Hong Kong is a metropolitan city in the located in the Eastern Perl River Delta of the South China Sea and New York is a city located where the Hudson river meets the Atlantic Ocean. Both these cities are culturally and ethinicaly very diverse and are also considered to be financial capitals of their respective regions. Moreover, the cities are fairly comparable in terms of their population density, area, gender ratio, and infrastructure. But how about the types of restaurants in these cities? Because of being prominent global cities, both Hong Kong and New York have a large influx of people from around the world who come for study, business, and leisure. Since the type of food is an important aspect of everyone's daily lives, it is be worthwhile to explore places to eat in these cities and find out which neighbouhoods fall into the same clusters. In this way, we can see if the restaurant options for a person living in a certain neighbourhood in NYC would be similar to options in a neighbourhood in Hong Kong. \n",

    "This project will explore and compare the types of restaurants in neighbourhoods of two cities - Hong Kong and New York - and segment neighbourhoods into different clusters. "

    "   Neighbourhood data for Hong Kong is taken from the Hong Kong Govrnment Open Data Site (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-hkpo-hkpo_ds01-hkpo-post-office). Since the number and location of post-offices in Hong Kong are a good measure of the number and location of neighbourhoods, this data taken as the neighbourhood data for Hong Kong. The data is in a json file that has three relevant fields: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. 'nameEN': The english name of the post office\n",

    "  \n",
    "         1. data['properties']['name']: Contains name of the neighbourhood\n",

The frequency of the category of restaurant will then be explored and venues with similar restaurant frequencies will be clustered together.  "
